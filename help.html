                    Welcome to the help page for <a class="join">Join</a>, your guide to using our kanban project
                    management tool. Here, we'll
                    provide
                    an overview of what <a class="join">Join</a> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use
                    it.</span></div>
            <h2 class="pdg-btm">What is Join?</h2>
            <div class="pdg-btm"><span><a class="join">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and
                    built by a group
                    of dedicated students as
                    part
                    of
                    their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</span></div>

            <div class="pdg-btm"><span> Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to
                    visualize work,
                    limit
                    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a class="join">Join</a> leverages the
                    principles of kanban to help
                    users
                    manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</span></div>

                <span class="explanation"><b>Exploring the Board</b>
                    <span>When you log in to <a class="join">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board
                        represents your project and contains
                        four
                        default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".</span></span>
            </div>
            <div class="steps-cont pdg-btm"><span class="number"><b>2.</b></span>
                <span class="explanation"><b>Creating Contacts</b>
                    <span> In <a class="join">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                        "Contacts" section, click on
                        "New
                        contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks
                        and
                        they
                        can
                        interact with the tasks on the board.</span></span>
            </div>
            <div class="steps-cont pdg-btm"><span class="number"><b>3.</b></span>
                <span class="explanation"><b>Adding Cards</b>
                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks.
                    Click
                    the
                    "+"
                    button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
                    task
                    name,
                    description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>

                <span class="explanation"><b>Moving Cards</b>
                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and
                    dropping
                    the
                    card
                    from one list to another.</span>
            </div>

            <div class="steps-cont pdg-btm"><span class="number"><b>5.</b></span>
                <span class="explanation"> <b>Deleting Cards</b>
                    <span> Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
                        card will
                        permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
                        action is
                        irreversible.
                        Remember that using <a class="join">Join</a> effectively requires consistent updates from you

                        board
                        reflects the current state of your project.
